# Projects

The projects directory contains code that's still in-development, either for research endeavors that haven't yet been incorporated into the game, or works that derive from work but ultimately don't feed back in. Also contains code relevant preserved to reproduce specific paper results.

Much of the code underneath isn't necessarily public-ready or well documented, but _should_ be for a clean paper release.

**Subdirectories:**
- **`aaai_world_building`**: Eclectic code related to our first [world building paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09194) around examining the impact AI-assisted tooling has on building interesting text worlds.
- **`dialog_and_act_trainer`**: Early experimental work around having a single model that is able to switch modes between dialogue and action, using model-based decisions on when to do each rather than heuristics.
- **`lightqa`**: Project code related to [knowledge-infused](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05204.pdf) LIGHT agents.
- **`long_context`**: Some code relevant to creating LIGHT longcontext examples.
- **`quest_generator`**: Some code relevant to generating a relevant quest for a given agent node.
- **`quest_scorer`**: Some code relevant to selecting a relevant quest for a given agent node.
- **`quests`**: Related content from the [LIGHT-quests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00685) paper.
