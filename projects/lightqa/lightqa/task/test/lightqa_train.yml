    - a dragon <SEP> Dragon is having a dream about being a dragon in the mountains.
    text: 'Weapon Closet, Somewhere

      The closet is a small dark room. There are different types of swords, axes,
      bows and arrows, and other types of weapons organized inside of the closet.
      It is just a barren, dark room with simple white walls and wooden floor.

      dragon: "I am a dragon living in the mountains. I enjoy hoarding treasure. I
      terrorize the local populace for fun."

      dragon: "“Wait ... how did I end up here?”"

      rat: "I brought you here in my spaceship. You slept for most of the ride. I
      don''t know if you know this but you are a big time drooler."

      dragon: "“Well ... um. Alright then. I must be having a fever dream”."

      look around and notice the bow, but more importantly I finally realized that
      a rat was talking to me*

      ... man I really shouldn’t have eaten that weird mushroom last night. So let
      me get this strait. You are a talking rat, and you brought me here in your space
      ship... why?”

      started to stare at the bow a little bit more hungrily.*

      rat: "And the dragon didn''t find you? Oh, my! What if this is a magic passage?
      I imagine a great and noble wizard casting a ward of protection over this whole
      castle!"

      dragon: "“I thought I was the dragon! Or ... erm I swore I just chomped through
      a knight with my sword like teeth. Maybe you are right. This is some magic passage.
      Well then my little ratty friend. How do we proceed?”"

      rat: "*squeak! The rat is struck by your shoe! More stunned than hurt, the creature
      attacks the footwear as if the whole thing was its idea. Biting and gnawing
      the shoe, the rat is once again distracted, and does not seem to notice you
      still in the passage.*."

      dragon: "I sigh with an exasperated breath and kick the rat away trying not
      to hurt the magical creature. Then looking away from the poor beast my hand
      reaches for the bow knowing full well a weapon could come in handy in the odd
      place. Turning my attention back towards the somewhat intelligent rat I try
      to grab its attention with a fib. “How about you and me go on a little adventure
      then? I promise cheese. Lots of it!”"

      rat: "We? Don''t include me in your idiotic scheming! Stay in the dock unless
      you''d rather end up in prison or the bottom of the sea!"

      dragon: "“Dock? Sea?” I look around the plain room and scratch my head assuming
      that maybe just outside is the supposed body of water. “Fine then I’ll proceed
      on my own. Best of luck my semi-intelligent rodentia.” I make sure the bow is
      firmly in my grasp and look around the room one more time to make sure I haven’t
      missed anything important like some other piece of gear."

      rat: "You may have some of my cheese, but I''ll be needing this. Being lost
      has made me more aggressive, I''ll say that."

      rat: "What is Dragon dreaming of being?"'

    text: 'The Queen''s Chamber, Somewhere

      This is a beautiful room inside of the palace that is decorated with the finest
      silk and velvet. The color scheme used represents royalty, royal blue, red,
      green and purple. The walls are covered in gold and in each corner of the room
      are golden statues of Greek art. The floors are covered in marble, and despite
      the patterns, shine so brightly you can even see your own reflection in them!
      There''s also a bed big enough to fit five people on!

      butler: "I serve my masters quietly. I know all the secrets of the elite but
      will never tell a soul. I have lived in this home since I was 12."

      butler: "Lead the way jester"

      jester: "Hello butler. How does the room look? I''m so tired of the queen yelling
      at me. Did I miss anything?"

      butler: "The drapes"

      jester: "That ugly thing? It makes me sick. It really makes an ugly contrast
      with the deep blue of the rug."

      butler: "So take them down"

      jester: "You''re kidding me right?! I''m a glorified jester, what do you expect
      me to do? A spider!"

      butler: "Kill it."

      jester: "I am a living joke, I can do anything you want me to do. I can even
      make you laugh."

      butler: "Make me laugh."

      jester: "Wait how do I not know if your a poisonous spider here to kill the
      king."

      butler: "hit jester"

      jester: "I am not a poisonous spider"

      jester: "Along with velvet, what is used in the decoration of The Queen''s Chamber?"'
