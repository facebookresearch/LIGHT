# quests

Contains all project-state work for the long-term objective of improving quest creation, assignment, and fulfillment inside LIGHT.

## Predictive Machines
Early code from the first steps for RL-based goal fulfillment in LIGHT. Work from that [initial paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02878).

## Sweeps
Currently contains sweeps used for our second [RL-Quests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00685) paper. Exposed for reference, though none of them can be run directly externally.
