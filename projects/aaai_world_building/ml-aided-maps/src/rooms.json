Tonight they are preparing two deer the king and his nobles caught while hunting, as well as some rabbit from a few days ago and seasoned vegetables. There are multiple fires around the kitchen to cook the animals and boil the vegetables, and combined with the heat of all the people the room is stifling. While the main kitchen workers are middle aged women who stay at one station, there are also younger children running around taking ingredients from one place to another. People are shouting instructions and gossip to one another constantly, so it is very hard to hear anything, but the atmosphere is very cheerful.",

    "description": "Toad Hollow is a filthy room within the Underwater Aquapolis. When you enter, you are greeted by the reek of scummy pond water. You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.",
