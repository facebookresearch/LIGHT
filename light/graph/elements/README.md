Contains the main `GraphNode` and `GraphEdge` types that comprise a LIGHT `OOGraph`.

At the moment, `GraphNode`s can have two different edge types. The first is a `GraphEdge`, which represents a relation between two nodes that are in the graph. The second is the more implicit attribute edge, which allows for `GraphNode`s to be identified as containers or having certain properties.
