# Scripts

This directory contains execution code for running LIGHT, exploring our dataset, filtering through examples, and more.

At the moment, subdirectories contain a mixture of complete and ready examples as well as deprecated older code that isn't relevant to LIGHT in its current form. Outside of `examples/play_map.py`, consider the rest present for usage examples or historical purposes.

Not everything here will remain here, and may be more appropriately stored elsewhere in the future.

**Subdirectories:**
- **`browse_game`**: Scripts we use to explore contents of the LIGHT main web deploy database.
- **`examples`**: Scripts that allow local live interaction with specific parts of the LIGHT platform.
- **`filtering`**: Scripts used to process and filter incoming data, primarily from the messenger project.
- **`labelling`**: Scripts to manually label and edit data from the LIGHT dataset or database.
- **`misc`**: Scripts for various other things that don't cleanly fit into other categories.
- **`training`**: Scripts for training various LIGHT models.
