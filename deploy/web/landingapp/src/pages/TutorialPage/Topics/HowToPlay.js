        You will be teleported into our mystical realm and fill the shoes of a
        character who lives there — playing that role you must act and talk with
        other LIGHT denizens. As you interact, your messages will be evaluated
        by the Dungeon Master AI. Portray your character well and you will
        increase your *experience points*. Other characters will also be playing
        their roles as well — some of them will be other human souls, others
        will be AIs. When everyone is playing their role to the best of their
        ability in the realm the experience will be maximized. You can *reward*
        other players when you are impressed by their skills. You can also
        *report* or demote unwanted behaviors: e.g., mentions of the real world
        or bad behavior. Stay good, my denizens!
