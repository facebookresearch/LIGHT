      <h4>Receiving Experience Points</h4>
      <p>
        Playing your role well will earn you experience points (EXP). For
        example playing the role of the jailer here with the following message
        to a goblin earns 4 EXP, as can be seen from the yellow star next to the
        message.
      </p>
      <img className="tutorialpage-image__row" src={ExperienceImg1} />
      <p>
        You can see your overall experience points and level in the top left
        panel. Earn enough experience to rise to the next level!
      </p>
      <img src={ExperienceImg2} />
      <p>
        This panel also tells you your characterâ€™s persona, and their mission.
        Roleplaying your character well means playing this described role!
      </p>
      <h4>Awarding Experience Points</h4>
      <p>
        If you believe another character is playing their role well, you can
        award them experience points! You can see your gift experience points in
        the star at the top left panel (shown here with 9 gift experience points
        with the mouse pointer resting over it):
      </p>
      <img src={AwardExperience1} />
      <p>
        To gift experience points, simply click on the message from your partner
        that you deemed worthy of praise:
      </p>
      <img src={AwardExperience2} />
      <h4>Reporting Players</h4>
      <p>
        If you see bad behavior by any player, you can report it. This could
        include clearly not playing their role, or offensive messages. To report
        it simply click on the flag icon next to their message:
      </p>
      <img src={ReportPlayer1} />
    </div>
  );
};
