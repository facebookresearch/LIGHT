        Playing your role well will earn you experience points (EXP). For
        example playing the role of the jailer here with the following message
        to a goblin earns 4 EXP, as can be seen from the yellow star next to the
        message.

      <img src={ExperienceImg1} />
      <p>
        You can see your overall experience points and level in the top left
        panel. Earn enough experience to rise to the next level!
      </p>
      <img src={ExperienceImg2} />
      <p>
        This panel also tells you your characterâ€™s persona, and their mission.
        Roleplaying your character well means playing this described role!
