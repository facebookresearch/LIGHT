    <h1>About LIGHT</h1>
    <p>
        LIGHT is a research project focused on creating realistic interactive AI.
        LIGHT stands for <i>“Learning in Interactive Games with Humans and Text.”</i> 
        The LIGHT game is a direct application of 
        <a href="https://parl.ai/projects/light/">our research</a>, and also stands as a 
        live environment to allow players to interact with models and other players directly. 
        We believe that by collecting gameplay interactions, we can train better agents to follow 
        stories and create meaningful experiences for players.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also feel that model-supported architectures can enable creators to tell their own stories. 
        Thus, much of our project’s research supports supporting user-created content in our world 
        builder. By reducing the barrier of entry to create full, fleshed out worlds, it should be 
        easier for anyone to create and share a slice of fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to regularly release complete anonymized and sanitized data collected from within 
        LIGHT, with the goal of enabling other researchers to extend upon our work, and this will 
        be available for download from the project page. The complete source code for the project 
        is available on our github.
