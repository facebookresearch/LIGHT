# Crowdsourcing

All LIGHT crowdsourcing tasks launched through regular crowd providers (like MTurk) belong in here. Overall this collection should be the full setup and deploy code for (nearly) all of the crowdsourced data used in LIGHT. Some are useful examples of how to collect similar types of data.

**Subdirectories:**
- **`custom_world_interactions`**: Tasks that together allow us to collect custom `GraphEvent` operations outside of the basic game engine. These allow LIGHT to have "common sense" interactions.
- **`dialogues`**: Tasks to improve the dialogue capabilities of models in specific situations.
- **`environment`**: Tasks to expand on or clean up the LIGHT environment.
- **`filtering`**: Tasks that allow us to filter out data collected in LIGHT for safety or other reasons.
- **`quests`**: Tasks for collecting quests and motivations for characters, as well as some plans or paths to accomplish those goals.
