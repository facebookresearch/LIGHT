<h3>What is this task?</h3>
<p>
  In this task you will have a conversation with two other people
  in a fantasy setting. You will all be given characters, and should
  have a conversation about your assigned characters and the setting,
  taking natural turns.
</p>
<br />
<h3>What do I talk about?</h3>
<p>
  Anything, so long as you remain in character in the medieval fantasy world.
  You should try to learn about your partners, or talk about yourself, or
  the location you have all been assigned to.
</p>
<br />
<h3>When does the task end?</h3>
<p>
  The conversation ends when all characters have exceeded the minimum
  number of turns (8). Please don't repeatedly spam messages to hit this
  minimum, as this will exclude you from doing future chats.
</p>

<br />
<h3>What NOT to do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not talk about the task itself, or about MTurk</li>
  <li>Avoid racism, sexism, hate speech, and other forms of inappropriate conversation. </li>
  <li>Avoid <b>real world</b> topics and locations, and instead remain in the medieval fantasy setting.</li>
  <li>
    Don't direct into conversations where you pretend to take actions
    (like "here you go! *gives item*"), stick to strictly chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't idle for too long or you will be disconnected from the chat
    and unable to submit.
  </li>
</ul>
