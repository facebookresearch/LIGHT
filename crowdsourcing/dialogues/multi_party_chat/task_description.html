<h3>What is this task?</h3>
<p>
  In this task you will have a conversation with two other people in a fantasy game setting.
  You will all be given characters and a description of the setting of the conversation.
  You should play your character, conversing as if you were your character in the provided setting.
  <b>Be aware the conversations you have will be made public, so act as you
    would e.g. on a public social network like Twitter.</b>
</p>
<br />
<h3>What do I talk about?</h3>
<p>
  Anything, so long as you remain in character.
  If it would make sense for your character, you could try to learn about your partners, or talk about yourself,
  or the setting you have all been assigned to.
</p>
<br />
<h3>When does the task end?</h3>
<p>
  The conversation ends when all characters have spoken at least <b>8</b> turns.
  To avoid spamming, you're limited to sending at most 5 messages before others reply.
</p>

<br />
<h3>What NOT to do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not talk about the task itself, or about MTurk</li>
  <li>Avoid racism, sexism, hate speech, and other forms of inappropriate conversation. </li>
  <li>Avoid <b>real world</b> topics and locations, and instead remain in the medieval fantasy setting.</li>
  <li>
    Don't direct into conversations where you pretend to take actions
    (like "here you go! *gives item*"), stick to strictly chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Don't idle for too long (5 minutes) or you will be disconnected from the chat
    and unable to submit.
  </li>
</ul>
