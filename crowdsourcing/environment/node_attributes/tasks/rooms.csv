2,The rectory,"This room is quite small and cramped. It's about the size of maybe three wooden carts, which is to say, it's very small. There are boxes all over the place and many candles and other church accessories. There are several big robes hanging next to what looks like a very small closet. Some candles shed an eerie light on the room, flickering softly. There is a small cabinet with several religious tapes and records and a few books. A book case is near and contains many common religious texts. The rectory is one of the most important rooms in the church, as it is where the priest and others get ready before they start church, where the put on robes and cassocks and the like. It is vital to the church as a matter of fact. Visibility to the room is blocked off by the altar in front of it, so church goers cannot see it unless they walk behind the altar. It seems to be used as a bit of a storage area for religious artifacts.",0,0

18,Southernmost Tower Entryway,"The rather drab tower was made of gray stones approximately all the same size. Artwork hung on the walls depicting battle scenes from long ago but even the color from these had faded with time. The cold, outside air seeped in through every small crack and crevice leaving a damp quality to the air. Sealed off rooms lined the perimeter and obviously had not been seen by human eyes for centuries. This tower was the first built to accompany the castle and was majestic in its heyday. It stood four stories tall, gleaming white with parapets on the top. The Southernmost Tower served as the guest quarters for visitors to the castle and was talked about throughout the land. After the Heinous Wars the castle was left to rot when its inhabitants fled for their lives. The castle and its accompanying tower stand as a footnote in history now.",0,0
20,Meadow,"Large clear outdoor meadow. Flowers of blue and white appearing in bunches here and there. The grass glows with a green light. Not much can be said about its appearance, however there is a mystical allure associated with the place as if a meadow for spirits instead of livestock. A great battle once held here.

24,mysterious forest outskirts,"The forest is a dark and mysterious place, where few but the bravest hunters dare wander. The trees loom over you, obscuring any sort of sunlight. Despite this, it is a valuable food and lumber resource for the nearby castle's inhabitants, for the trees are tall and thick and a plentiful amount of deer wander about within. The vast expanse of the forest is one of the greatest mysteries for the local castle. No one knows where it ends, for even the brave hunters dare only travel to its outermost depths. As a result, it is likely that the forest has grown and grown for the past hundred years, and no one is willing to explore deeper, for there are myths of a mythical dragon king's castle in its innermost depths.",0,0
26,Castle farm,"The farm is a large patch of land located directly outside of the castle walls. A wide variety of grains, vegetables and fruits are grown here to feed the castle's people. A few lone barns are scattered across the farmland, housing a wide array of farm animals that are slaughtered for their delicious meats. The farms were a necessity for the castle to be able to sustain itself during winters and sieges.

The farmers always made sure there was a plentiful amount of harvest to last during these harsh times.",0,0
28,The Lower Dungeon Guard Room,"This chamber, a full 30 feet below the Upper Dungeon, isn't made of stone blocks, it's hewn from the living rock of the earth.  10 by 15 feet, its domed ceiling and walls show the tool marks its excavation.  There are numerous lines of filth on the walls marking the various levels that water has risen up the walls during previous rainy seasons.

A wobbly table sits in the center of the room, but there are no chairs to go with it.  Rusty cuffs hang from rusty pegs driven into the wall.  The smell is horrific.

This Lower Dungeon is for those who act against the King.  The King ensures that all the nobility know about this horrible place.",0,0

Three chairs and a table with a lamp are what is left in the middle of the safe-room. Dimly lit, and a steady water supply coming from the well outside of the cottage. The safe-room is the last option of defense against the Genii. If the Genii get past the outside gates of the cottage, then the safe-room is the becomes the next objective point. What gives the safe-room its value, is the ability to cloak the door.",0,0
32,In Front of a Stone Tower,"A large tower stretches high into the sky. It is made of gray stone blocks, some of which have softened edges illustrating aged signs of wear. Sparse grass grows around the base of the tower, dwindling down to nothing near the dark open doorway at the tower's front. A few rays of light shine into the doorway and brighten a rough stone floor, with specks of dust being illuminated by the sun's rays. This tower was created a long time ago by workers unknown. It appears rather old, but has withstood the test of time.",0,0
34,A small church,"It's a very humble abode - any smaller and you could mistake it for someone's home.  In the front room is a small altar for prayer and offerings.  The two rooms to the sides are places where the priest and a traveler can rest. There are many roadside churches in the land and this is but one of them.  Most travelers come here to rest on their way to the nearest town, still a day's travel away.",0,0

A single bulb of light illuminates the small hall that the entrance leads to. The entrance smells of the fresh outdoors. This cottage seems strangely ahead of its time for a place so underwhelming. The owner is something of a tinkerer and the furnishings and contraptions reflect the work of either a madman or a genius.",0,0

62,Abandoned Mine,"A crumbling hole gapes in the side of the stone, surrounded by rotted wood timbers. A few rusted pieces of block and tackle lay half-buried in scraggly grass. A strange sort of humming noise emanates from within. A generation ago, people sought their fortunes here. After a decade, they'd discovered heartbreak, sorrow, and agony.

64,An Unfinished Mausoleum,"Two-and-a-half walls of the finest, whitest stone stand here, weathered by the passing of countless seasons. There is no roof, nor sign that there ever was one. All indications are that the work was abruptly abandoned. There is no door, nor markings on the walls. Nor is there any indication that any coffin has ever lain here... yet. Bright white stone was all the fad for funerary architecture, once upon a time. It's difficult to understand why someone would abandon such a large and expensive undertaking. If they didn't have the money to finish it, they could have sold the stone, surely - or the mausoleum itself. Maybe they just haven't needed it yet? A bit odd, though, given how old it is. Maybe the gravedigger remembers... if he's sober.",0,0

Baskets of freshly-caught fish, bivalves, and eels sit in the shade in stained wooden troughs of water. A small, aggressive-looking dog is chained to one table, presumably to keep cats away. The stall is redolent with the aroma of fish. Where there's water, there are fish, and where there are fish, there are stories about ""the one that got away"", and of course fishermen. As they can be unpleasantly salty characters unfit for the company of the more genteel sorts of ladyfolk, enterprising individuals act as middlemen, buying fresh-caught seafood from these disreputable sorts and selling them on. This is one such enterprise, which has clearly both been here a while, and not been entirely prosperous.",0,0

While escape is possible through other means, slipping five copper to the militiaman in charge of relieving you of your wares may grant you access to the tunnel.

Even the wall above the door as you enter is a shelf full of books of all sorts. The smell of paper and some mold (they are rather old books) permeates the air. A large overstuffed settee is faced by a short table and across from that are two matching chair. All are brown in color and look to be extremely comfortable.

There are two ornate gold chairs for the King and Queen when they are sitting on the balcony. Small tables of gold are scattered about, for use and decoration. The grand balcony is where the King goes when he needs to think. He goes there to think over war strategies (if the need arises), how to deal with issues of his people, if the Queen is angry with him, or any other problems. The King is particularly proud of the design of the balcony, as it is like no other. He hand-picked the creatures that graced the railing, and it feels a part of him was put into as it was designed.

Scattered glass litters the floor, broken ale bottles where some of the poor have tried to stay in the den, before the rat's had over taken it. There are torches on the wall, but dim now, as no soul wants to see the what the light would show. There are rat's nests in the corner, bits of straw, cloth and other odds and ends the rats have dug up. The rat den used to be a storage room, before the mad King became the ruler. It stored crates of lovely dishes, ornaments and treasures. It was kept clean, with servants coming and going to get items, as well as store them.

However, just as the tides change, so do the moods of the people that swim within them.

1296,Frozen Outpost,"One of the outposts of the king's army in the northern Kingdom of Thylar. The outpost overlooks the camp, which at first look actually seems rather abandoned to the untrained citizen.

1302,Research Laboratory,"The lab itself is almost as desolate as the wasteland outside of it; most of the research was cleared out of here long ago, so now there's mostly nothing but empty shelves. There are, however, a few boxes of medicinal supplies left behind, sitting along the back wall from the door. A silver refrigerator with a few vials in it sits next to a sink that's been unused for quite some time. This place was founded almost 31 years ago.

1304,The Fountain of Youth,"The water here bubbles softly, cascading down the golden framework of the fountain.  The water is clear as crystal, and shimmers softly with a faint glow that doesn't seem to quite reflect the light around it.  The fountain itself is made of elaborately filigrees of gold and silver that twist and curve to show the sparkle of the water best, and it breathtaking to behold. While the fountain's beauty is what first draws the eye, a careful glace down at the earth around it reveals a frightening sight.  Skeletons, some clad in ancient armor from kingdoms long turned to dust, others worn down so that even what clothing they had has long since disintegrated, litter the earth.  Beautiful flowers grow up from them, partially obscuring whatever carnage caused these people to perish. The Fountain of Youth has long been a story of legend among mortal folk.  Yet, as with any magic in these realms, there is oft a price to be paid to cheat Nature of her rights.  While many whisper and dream of finding this mysterious fountain, and over the centuries many a brave knight has searched, no one has ever returned from visiting this perilous place.",0,0

1318,Toad Hollow,"Toad Hollow is a filthy room within the Underwater Aquapolis. When you enter, you are greeted by the reek of scummy pond water. You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place. Toad Hollow is a legend among knights young and old. Mostly, it's discovered by children playing down in the sewers who take a combination of turns through the drainage pipes and wind up there by accident. Some braze knights have purposefully tried to find Toad Hollow and been successful but most have not glimpsed the creature. Toad Hollow remains shrouded in mystery to this day and many question if it's even real. Some say that you should be careful not to get caught on the armor of the drowned when you're wading through and that hands have reached up from the bottom of the water and grabbed their ankles.",0,0
